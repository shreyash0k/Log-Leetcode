Problem 
So imagine you're on the Google Ads team. When an advertiser creates a campaign, they set a specific daily budget — say $500. Our system needs to find exactly two ad placements from a list of available slots, where the combined cost of those two placements hits the advertiser's budget exactly. We want to return which two placements those are so we can auto-fill the campaign. For example, if we have placement costs like $200, $700, $300, and the budget is $500, we'd pair the $200 and $300 slots. How would you design a function to do this?

Code - 
# slots = [200, 700, 300]
# target = 500
# otuput = 
findPair(slots, target):
	# if there are less than 2 slots return -1 
	if len(slots)<2:
		return (-1,-1)
	# create an empty hashmap with key as cost and value as index
	hashSlots = {}
	
	# go over list of items and check if target - current exists in hashmap 
	for i in range(0,len(slots)):
		if target - slots[i] in hashSlots: 
			return (i, hashSlots[target - slots[i]))
		hashSlots[slots[i]] = i     
	
	# if nothing found return -1,-1
	return (-1,-1)

# tc: we are going over full list of inputs, so O(n) for that. for each input we check if other pair exist in hashmap. HashMap lookup is O(1). storing is also O(1)
#sc is O(n) because we might store all unique costs in hashmap.
